# flashcards
Fullstack web application created for school. I worked with an Agile team
with my classmates and did 'mini-sprints' along with daily stand-ups with a Scrum master,
and a product owner.

The application, also known as Ninja Flashcards, utilizes a pgAdmin database to keep track
of student's flashcards for studying. You can share flashcards with your friends based off just
the URL if set to public, or you can have flashcard decks for private use.

There is also tracking for your study sessions per user. If you're logged in and complete a study session,
your performance based off the deck will be tracked and saved for a later session.
